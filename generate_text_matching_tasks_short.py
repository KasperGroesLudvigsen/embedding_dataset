    Here are a few examples:
    - Given a scientific paper title, retrieve the title of papers that cite the given paper.
    - Match a word with its definition.
    - Provided a notable personâ€™s name, identify their occupation or achievement.
    Your output must always be a python list of strings only, with about 20 elements, and each element corresponds to a distinct
