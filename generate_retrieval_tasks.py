Here are a few examples for your reference:
- Retrieve relevant documents for a short keyword web search query that asks for weather information.
- Search for documents that answers a FAQ-style query on childrenâ€™s nutrition.
Please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Specify what the query is, and what the desired documents are.
- Each retrieval task should cover a wide range of queries, and should not be too specific.
Your output must always be a python list of strings only, with about 20 elements, and each element corresponds to a distinct
retrieval task in one sentence. Do not explain yourself or output anything else. Be creative!"""
