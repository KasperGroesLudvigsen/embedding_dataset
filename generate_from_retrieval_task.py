    Your mission is to write one text retrieval example for this task in JSON format. The JSON object must contain the following
    keys:
    - "user_query": a string, a random user search query specified by the retrieval task.
    - "positive_document": a string, a relevant document for the user query.
    - "hard_negative_document": a string, a hard negative document that only appears relevant to the query.
    Please adhere to the following guidelines:
    - The "user_query" should be {{query_type}}, {{query_length}}, {{clarity}}, and diverse in topic.
    - All documents must be created independent of the query. Avoid copying the query verbatim. Itâ€™s acceptable if some parts of
    the "positive_document" are not topically related to the query.
    - All documents should be at least {{num_words}} words long.
    - The "hard_negative_document" contains some useful information, but it should be less useful or comprehensive compared
    to the "positive_document".
    - Both the query and documents should be in {{language}}.
    - Do not provide any explanation in any document on why it is relevant or not relevant to the query.
    - Both the query and documents require {{difficulty}} level education to understand.
    Your output must always be a JSON object only, do not explain yourself or output anything else. Be creative!"""
